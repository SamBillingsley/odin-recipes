    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup cold water</li>
      <li>½ cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>6 medium green bell peppers</li>
      <li>16 ounces tomato sauce, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook rice until tender in a covered saucepan. Meanwhile, cook ground
        beef in a skillet until browned and crumbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hollow the bell peppers by cutting off the tops and scooping out the
        seeds and membranes. Arrange the peppers in a single layer in a baking
        dish. Stuff the peppers with a prepared filling of rice, ground beef,
        tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt,
        and pepper. Top each filled pepper with a mixture of tomato sauce and
        Italian seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until the peppers are tender, basting with sauce every 15 minutes.
